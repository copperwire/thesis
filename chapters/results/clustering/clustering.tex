\chapter{Clustering of AT-TPC events}

The approach to the clustering of events is different to the semi supervised approach in a couple of meaningful ways. Firstly it's a harder task, as we'll demonstrate, which necessitates a more exploratory approach to the problem. Secondly as a a consequence of the challenge the focus will be a bit different than for the semi-supervised approach. We will still utilize the same architectures and models starting with a search over the parameter space over which we measure the performance using the ARS (adjusted rand score) and NMI (normalized mutual information) defined in section \ref{sec:unsupervised_perf}. And as with the chapter on the semi-supervised results we start with considering the VGG16 pre-trained model as a benchmark.
