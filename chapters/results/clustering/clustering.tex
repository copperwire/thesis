\chapter{Clustering of AT-TPC events}\label{chap:clustering}

The principal challenge in the AT-TPC experiments that we're trying to solve is the reliance on labelled samples in the analysis. While the ${}^{46}$Ar experiment has conveniently visually dissimilar reaction products, which facilitates supervised learning, this is not necessarily the case for other experiments. The ${}^{46}$Ar experiment provides a convenient example where we can then explore unsupervised techniques. In this chapter, we explore the application of clustering techniques to events represented in latent spaces. 

We begin by exploring a naive K-means approach on the latent space of a pre-trained network. Subsequently we investigate other clustering methods and two autoencoder based clustering algorithms as outlined in section \ref{sec:deep_clustering}.

This chapter builds on the previous results from semi-supervised classification. We observe that we are able to construct high quality latent spaces, which facilitates the investigation of clustering techniques. 

The approach for clustering of events is different than the semi-supervised approach in two meaningful ways. First, it's a harder task, as we'll demonstrate. This necessitates a more exploratory approach to the problem. Second, as a a consequence of the challenge the focus will be a bit different than for the semi-supervised approach. We will still utilize the same architectures and models starting with a search over the parameter space over which we measure the performance using the adjusted rand score (ARS) and accuracy defined in section \ref{sec:unsupervised_perf} and \ref{sec:supervised_perf}, respectively.

As with the chapter on the semi-supervised results we start with considering the VGG16 pre-trained model as a benchmark.

Lastly, we note that the focus of this work is largely on discovering possible avenues for further research, which requires a broad scan of possible avenues rather than a rigorous analysis of one specific model.
