\chapter{Clustering of AT-TPC events}\label{chap:clustering}

In the previous chapter on classification results we observe that we are able to construct high quality latent spaces.  

The approach to the clustering of events is different to the semi supervised approach in a couple of meaningful ways. Firstly it's a harder task, as we'll demonstrate, which necessitates a more exploratory approach to the problem. Secondly as a a consequence of the challenge the focus will be a bit different than for the semi-supervised approach. We will still utilize the same architectures and models starting with a search over the parameter space over which we measure the performance using the ARS (adjusted rand score) and NMI (normalized mutual information) defined in section \ref{sec:unsupervised_perf}. And as with the chapter on the semi-supervised results we start with considering the VGG16 pre-trained model as a benchmark.
