\section{Discussion}
In this section we will review the results presented in the previous section. The section is divided in topics of task, first we will consider the classification performance of our two implemented algorithms on the three different dataset; simulated, cleaned and full representations. This performance will be contextualized by measuring against the results on similar tasks in the work of \citet{Kuchera2019}.
