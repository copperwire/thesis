\chapter{Discussion}
In this chapter, we review the results presented in the previous chapter. We divide the discussion into topics of task. First, we will consider the classification performance of our two implemented algorithms on the three different datasets: simulated, filtered and full AT-TPC data. 

We begin by considering the semi-supervised classification performance. From these results, we wish to characterize the latent spaces produced by the different algorithms qualitatively. The performance is contextualized by measuring against the results on similar tasks in the work of \citet{Kuchera2019}. Furthermore, the semi-supervised performance serves as a proof-of-concept for the construction of high-quality latent spaces in an AT-TPC experiment.

Turning then to the more challenging task of clustering explore the implications of our methods to further research on unsupervised clustering in the AT-TPC experiment.
