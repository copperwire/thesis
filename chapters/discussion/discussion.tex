\chapter{Discussion}
In this chapter we will review the results presented in the previous chapter. The section is divided in topics of task, first we will consider the classification performance of our two implemented algorithms on the three different datasets: simulated, filtered and full AT-TPC data. 

We begin by considering the semi-supervised classification performance. From these we wish to qualitatively characterize the latent spaces produced by the different algorithms. The performance will be contextualized by measuring against the results on similar tasks in the work of \citet{Kuchera2019}. Furthermore, the semi-supervised performance serves as a proof-of-concept for the construction of high quality latent spaces in an AT-TPC experiment.

Turning then to the harder task of clustering explore the implications of our methods to further research on unsupervised clustering in the AT-TPC experiment.
