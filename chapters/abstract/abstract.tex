In this thesis, we introduce the application of convolutional autoencoder neural networks to the analysis of two-dimensional projections of particle tracks from a resonant proton scattering experiment on ${}^{46}Ar$. This experiment was recorded by an active target time-projection chamber (AT-TPC). Moreover, we also build on recent works applying pre-trained models from the image analysis community to this type of data.

Machine learning presents an interesting avenue for researchers operating an AT-TPC, as traditional analysis methods of AT-TPC data are both computationally expensive and fits all particle tracks against the event type of interest - the latter presents a considerable challenge when the space of reactions is not known prior to the analysis. 

We explore the performance of the autoencoder networks and a pre-trained VGG16 model on two tasks: a semi-supervised classification task and the unsupervised clustering of particle tracks. On the semi-supervised task, we find that a logistic regression classifier trained on the latent space of these models performs very well on simulated data, with a $f1>0.9$. The VGG16 latent achieves this result with as few as $N=100$ samples, as does the convolutional autoencoder when trained on the VGG16 representations of the particle tracks. Furthermore, we found that the autoencoder model reduces the variability in the identification of proton events by $64\%$ from the benchmark logistic regression classifier trained on the VGG16 latent space on real experimental data. 

On the clustering task, we found that a K-means algorithm applied to the simulated data in the VGG16 latent space forms almost perfect clusters, with an $ARI > 0.8$.  Additionally, the VGG16+K-means approach finds high purity clusters of proton events for real experimental data. We also explore the application of neural networks to clustering by implementing a mixture of autoencoders algorithm. With this model we improved clustering performance on the real experimental data from an $ARI = 0.17$ to an $ARI = 0.40$. However, the neural network clustering suffers from severe stability issues prohibiting its application to new experiments without further research.
