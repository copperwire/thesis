\section{Research question and hypotheses}
In this thesis we explore the following research question and hypotheses 

\begin{enumerate}[start=0, label={(\bfseries R\arabic*):}]
\item To what degree are we able to separate event classes from an AT-TPC experiment. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent with the related hypotheses 

\begin{enumerate}[start=0, label={(\bfseries H\arabic*):}]
\item[] There exists a mapping from raw AT-TPC data to some lower dimensional vector space $\mathbf{z}$ such that: 
\item a set of hyperplanes in this space separates the event types present
\item the mapping clusters the event types present in disjoint sets under some distance metric
\end{enumerate}

\section{Why machine learning?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Advent of large amounts of data \\
\item Precedence from High energy \\
\item Promise of discovery from unsupervised methods \\
\item Need for exploration 
\end{itemize}
