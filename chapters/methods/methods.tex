\chapter{Methods}

In this chapter, we will introduce the algorithms we have implemented for this thesis. Additionally, we will demonstrate their application to simulated AT-TPC (active target time-projection chamber) data. The algorithms were presented in chapter \ref{ch:autoencoder}, and we refer to this chapter for details on the theory. All the algorithms implemented for this thesis are written in the \lstinline{Python} programming language. We chose python for the ability to rapidly prototype and algorithm, as well as the availability of mature machine learning libraries. Plots of algorithmic performance, and data visualization was achieved with the matplotlib package (\cite{matplotlib}), and data was managed with the \lstinline{numpy} package for numerical python (\cite{numpy}).

The algorithms we implemented were written using the TensorFlow library for deep learning. Accodingly, we begin this chapter by describing the TensorFlow framework.
